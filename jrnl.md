# Journal

2013-05-08 [Github Pages Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually) seems intentionally puzzling so to discourage people outside of git and the github community from using it. Yet the instructions are straight forward enough that It's easy to follow without understanding.

I only just started using git and github. I was very attracted by the version control pormises by git. And so far it hasn't failed me as I stumble to commit more consistently.

Come to think of it, this Journal.md and the random index page is on the gh-pages 'orphan' branch. Does that mean I would have commit history?
